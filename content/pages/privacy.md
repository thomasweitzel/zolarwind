## General notes

Protecting your personal data matters. This website is a **static information site** and can be used **without providing personal data**.

I do **not** actively collect personal data unless optional features are used, in particular:

- no contact forms
- no tracking
- no analytics or marketing services
- no comments or user accounts without explicit consent

## Responsible controller

The responsible controller for data processing on this website is the person named in the [imprint](@/pages/imprint.md).

## Hosting

This website is hosted by **an internet hosting provider**.

The web server stores information in its log files, some of which your browser transmits:

- IP address
- date and time of the request
- requested page
- HTTP status code
- referrer URL
- browser and operating system information

This data is used only for **technical operation**, **security**, and **error analysis**.

**Legal basis:** Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR \
**Legitimate interest:** secure and stable operation of the website

The log data are stored separately and not used for profiling.

## Data processing

I have signed a data processing agreement with the hosting provider under Art. 28 GDPR.

## Cookies and browser data storage {#cookies}

This website does not use cookies.

Browser storage is used in these cases:

- After an **active click on the theme toggle**, to store the display setting (`light` or `dark`) for this session in
  the browser (`sessionStorage`). Legal basis: Section 25(2) No. 2 TDDDG.
- When using the comment function, to store user-provided data and technical session information for later
  comments in the browser, e.g. username/nickname, email address, optional website (`localStorage`). Legal basis:
  Section 25(1) TDDDG and Art. 7 GDPR.

The data storage takes place exclusively locally in the browser. Entries can be deleted there at any time.

## External content and services

This website does **not** embed external content (e.g., YouTube, Google Fonts, tracking scripts).
All resources (scripts, images, etc.) are served locally.

## SSL/TLS encryption

This website uses SSL/TLS encryption. Data transmitted during a page request cannot be read by third parties.

## Rights of data subjects

You have the right to:

- access to stored personal data
- correction or deletion
- data portability where applicable
- restriction of processing
- objection to processing

These rights mainly apply to technically necessary server log data. If you use the comment function, the data you enter
(e.g. name/nickname, email address, optional website) and the comment content may also be processed. In that case, the
same rights apply. On request, a comment can be deleted or anonymized unless statutory retention obligations prevent this.

Requests can be sent via the contact address in the imprint.

## Supervisory authority and right to file a complaint

You have the right to file a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority. The competent authority is the
authority of your federal state of residence or the seat of the responsible controller.
